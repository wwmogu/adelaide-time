# adelaide-time

Given a time in another time zone, get the time in Adelaide.

## Original idea

"I'm pretty bad at converting time for different countries, so I want to make a tool that can strengthen my brain."

Simply, I will give the country name, then I will get the converted Adelaide time.

Further development, visualize all available countries' time.
